# BinaryClassifiers
Binary Classification 

This is my first project using Artificial Neural Networks on a Binary Classification task. I am hoping to expand this project to include various types of binary classifiers including my own algorithms.
This project was also useful in learning about pythons abstract class library (abc), which will be helpful in expanding the project in the future.
I make use of the following libraries. Make sure to download them using the command: **pip install [lib]** 

- tensorflow
- keras
- abc
- numpy
- pandas

Finally, you can run a test of the classifier using the titanic dataset by downloading the files:

- __init__.py
- Binary_classification_models.py
- parser_.py

and running the command: **python Binary_classification_models.py**
